## Hi, I'm Will Merrill! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ph.D. student at New York University interested in the theoretical foundations of language and computation. Most of my research has focused on understanding how artificial neural networks process the syntax and semantics of natural languages. Recently, my research has focused on understanding (a) the model of computation in transformers and (b) the ability of large language models to grasp the meaning of text.

I've also done a fair amount of amateur game development, just for fun.
