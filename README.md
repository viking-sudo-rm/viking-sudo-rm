## Hi, I'm Will Merrill! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ph.D. student at New York University interested in the theoretical foundations of language and computation. Most of my research has focused on understanding the computational power of language modeling architectures, with an eye towards understanding their language processing and reasoning capabilities.

I've also done a fair amount of amateur game development, just for fun.
