## Hi, I'm Will Merrill! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ph.D. student at New York University interested in the theoretical foundations of language and computation. Most of my research has focused on understanding how neural network models process the syntax and semantics of natural languages.

I've also done a fair amount of amateur game development, just for fun.
